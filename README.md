# SyMBac: Synthetic Micrographs of Bacteria

**Update 2025** There is currently a big update coming which will feature lineage tracking ability, full texture generation within cells, spatial fluorescence (membrane, nucleoid, ribosome, etc), and more advanced image simulation models, and BENDY cells! It will also (hopefully) bring about full modularity of SyMBac so you can plug in individual parts of the pipeline to your own workflows.
